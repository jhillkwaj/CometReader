The .jar file can be run on any android device running Android 4.0 or higher.
To run it copy it onto your device, navigate to it in memory, and install it.
Make sure you have Unknown Sources enabled in your devices security settings.
If you wish to view the included source code I would recommend using Android Studio as that was the program it was written in.

Thank You
